// - The `correct()` function  is where the important stuff happens.  It takes in a
//   sequence of points; these are the points where the user touched the screen. It
//   then finds all the words  of the correct length,  scores them according to the
//   scoring algorithm below, and uses a `Heap` with capacity `maxcount` to collect
//   the most likely words.  Words with scores lower than `cutoff` are not included
//   in the output.


// ### Scoring

// To score a word, compare each character to the corresponding point in the points
// sequence.  Calculate `d`,  the  Euclidean  distance  between  the point  and the
// location of that letter on a QWERTY keyboard.  Then calculate `s`, the score for
// that character: `s = 1 / (10 dÂ² + 1)`.  The score for the word is the mean score
// of all of its letters.  The higher the score, the better the match.

// A score is only defined for words with the same length as the point sequence.
